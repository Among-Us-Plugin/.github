# Among-Us-Plugin

## Among Us - Minecraft Java plugin for Paper (Unofficial)

This project was created as a unique way to bring two well-known games together: Among Us and Minecraft. Being a Minecraft Java plugin, server administrators can simply drag and drop a compiled JAR to add AUP alongside their server's existing plugins and worlds/custom maps.
